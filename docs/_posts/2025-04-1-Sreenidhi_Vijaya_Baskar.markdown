On Monday, 31st March, I started work experience at Red Hat. Although I was nervous coming in, however, as soon as the ice breaker started things started to feel better. I got a chance to meet new people. I also learned a lot more about Red Hat and its services and the importance of companies like Red Hat working behind the scenes on things we need in our daily lives, e.g., online banking.  

I spent a lot of the day talking with new people and got to look around the Red Hat building. One thing I enjoyed about the day was the fact that we had longer breaks. I think this was important to have on the first day to get used to working and learning for the next few days.  

We also learned about Agile and Scrum and the importance of teamwork and communication. We put these skills to use by building potato heads based on a chosen theme by our project manager. Our theme was Marvel. We were given two boxes with random items that we had to look through and source parts suitable for each team. Me and my team were quite lucky to have made five potato heads as we found many parts and pieces related to marvel to put together.  

Overall, my first day in Red Hat was very fun. I had a great time and am looking forward to the week ahead!

## Tuesday

Today we started the day with a stand up telling everyone what we did the day before. This helped me learn how companies like Red Hat work efficiently on a team as each person has to give an update on what they did the day before and their progress so far.  We learned about GitHub and created our own accounts to login and write up daily blogs for the week. We wrote our first blog today on all the things we did on Monday. 

Afterwards, we learned how to code with Python. This was interesting because although I have already used Python before I got the chance to expand my coding skills. The workshop was clear and easy to follow, and I had a great time coding again.  

Next, we did a cybersecurity lesson: "How to Crack One Million Passwords." This was great way to learn about the importance of having a good password. The more passwords I cracked the longer I had to wait for the results. I never finished the lesson as the wait time for 1 million passwords was simply too long. However, it was enjoyable and easy to code.

Overall, today was a great day and I am looking forward for the rest of the week.

## Wednesday

This morning, we started off with our stand up with Jennefer as ususal. Then we wrote our blogs for Tuesday. Doing the blogs is great because it lets s recall what happened the previous day and is a fantastic way to remember the week.  

After our blogs we listened to a talk about Cloud Computing from James. He talked about what it was, the history of computers and how much things have changed, as well as recent things like AI and what is yet to come in the future. We also learned about the type of jobs we can do if we work in a company like Red Hat.  

Afterwards we did lessons of our own choice from cybersecurity. I tried something new and something I had done and enjoyed before: "How to Steal a Pizza."  

Lastly, we were given an hour and a half to build our own roller coasters with paper cups, duct tape, and paper straws. This was a part of Agile and was so fun as we had to create a loop in our roller coasters! In the end, my team's roller coaster won, but overall, it was an excellent task to be communicative and creative while working together. I had a blast building it!

## Thursday

We started off the day with our stand up at 9:15 and then started our Wednesday blogs. Next, we had a Town Hall meeting in the room we do work experience in. This happens every two weeks in Red Hat where updates are given, information is exchanged, and new team members are introduced. James (leading the meeting) also asked all of us, so we went around and said one fun fact about us. The meeting was interesting and fun to listen to.   

Next, we had a talk on AI form Wolfgang. I did not know much about the details how AI worked until today, so I found this talk intriguing and relative to today's society. After a quick break we went back in for a talk on Bash from Krysztof where we learned how to move data in File Explorer in an easier way using Bash. We also got to play a little game ("Ghost Busters") where we had to find and move 4 files (Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde) back into a file called Jail. This got us used to moving files and learning different functions in Bash.  

Near the end of the day, we split into pairs and did a presentation on either rain gardens or sustainability for our sustainability project. We had 40 minutes to work on it and later presented to the group. Presenting was great to practice walking in front of people and conveying concise information.  

Today was a great day and I am excited for my final day at Red Hat.

## Friday

![Red Hat Office](https://wiki.keyestudio.com/images/thumb/7/7d/Ks0356.png/700px-Ks0356.png)

Today was my last day in Red Hat and to start the day off we had a little bit of a chat. My favourite thing about today was learning how to code using micro: bit. It was a great refresher for me, and I also got to learn a few new things about block coding using micro: bit. Our goal today was to get into pairs and make code so that we can race our robot cars. We split into a team of senders and receivers and each pair had to create separate code for the car to operate. The code started off relatively okay (making the car accelerate), but it soon got a lot longer and more complicated (making the car reverse). The projector screen was also far away making the code hard to see. In the end after trying a few things Stevan and the other interns set up the rest of the code for us. When we were finally finished, it was decided to race them after lunch.  

When we got back the racetrack was already set up with duct tape for the track and dressed up potato heads along the way as obstacles. The task was simple: Race the car along the track without leaving the tape or hitting the potato heads. A 5 second penalty for leaving the track and a 10 second penalty for hitting the potato heads. Each pair went individually, and the timings were recorded. When it was my turn, I avoided crashing with the potato heads, but I did leave the track once, I think. Racing the car was a lot more fun and easier than I had expected and I was fascinated that we can code so many things to work according to its purpose just like the race car.  

After that the interns and other workers also took part in the racing. We also lined up to take a group photo with Red Hats in the entrance up the office. Then we were given Red Hat merchandise and then we waited for parents to arrive for the parent tour. I said my goodbyes to the interns who thought us many new things related to IT throughout the week and went along on the tour with my parents. I did feel a little sad that the week was already over, but I was glad I made the most of it.   

Overall, my week was absolutely fantastic, and I learned many new things and improved on things I was already familiar with. I also learned to communicate and work as a team better. I also realised that before starting anything a great strategy will result in a great job of your task. For example, planning out the structure of my team’s rollercoaster helped us picture it in our heads and create a close replica of an actual roller coaster while being able to loop. One thing that stood out to me was the realisation that I enjoyed things like coding and the work you do in IT.  I had an interesting week and I’m glad I got this opportunity.
